#+title: Memeozi

* Introduction
A library for memoizing functions
#+begin_src bash
git clone https://github.com/garlic0x1/memeozi.git ~/quicklisp/local-projects/
#+end_src

* Usage
Use defmemo just like defun, results of the function will be stored in a #'equal hash-table which is checked before doing work when called again:
#+begin_src lisp
(ql:quickload :memeozi)
(use-package :memeozi)

(defmemo times (a b)
  (* a b))

(is (= 8 (times 2 4)))
#+end_src

Use defmemo/atomic for a thread-safe version of defmemo, only reading and writing to the memo table hold the lock, the lock is not held while the result is being calculated.

Use defmemo/int->int to use a vector of integers and lookup by index, this is useful for number chain problems as demonstrated in the tests.
